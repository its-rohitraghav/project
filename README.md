Analyzing genetic insight using the gene data
The DisGeNET dataset is a rich, integrative resource designed to explore the complex landscape of gene-disease associations (GDAs). It consolidates data from multiple expert-curated databases, GWAS catalogs, animal models, and scientific literature to offer a comprehensive view of how genes influence human diseases.

🔬 Project Highlight: Unveiling Gene-Disease Associations in Mental Disorders using DisGeNET
This project leverages the comprehensive DisGeNET database to uncover genetic contributions to mental disorders and support biomedical innovation. Key highlights include:

🧬 Gene-Disease Mapping: Identified and visualized associations between genes and mental health conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. This enables a deeper understanding of the genetic landscape influencing psychiatric diseases.

📊 Genetic Risk Factor Analysis: Assessed DisGeNET confidence scores to quantify the strength of gene-disease links, highlighting high-risk genes that may play critical roles in disease development and progression.

🧪 Biomedical Research Support: The curated gene-disease data provides a valuable resource for discovering diagnostic biomarkers, advancing precision medicine, and developing targeted therapeutic strategies.

📈 Temporal Trend Tracking: Explored historical data to analyze how gene-disease relationships have evolved over time, offering insights into research focus shifts and emerging genetic findings.

🤖 AI & Drug Discovery Enablement: Structured the dataset to train AI models capable of predicting disease risk and identifying novel drug targets, accelerating the pace of drug development and personalized treatment.
